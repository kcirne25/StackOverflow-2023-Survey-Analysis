### 1 - Installation
The code runs in Python and the libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib were used through the analysis.\

### 2 - Project Motivation
The Stack Overflow 2023 developers survey was used to verify the expertise and opinion of users in the following questions:

- Which Programming/Scripting Languages are professionals interested in a near future?
- Are users using AI tools? Are users favorable on using them?
- Is the YearsCode group relevant when analyzing the sentiment of using AI?\

### 3 - File Descriptions
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

### 4 - Results
After analyzing the data, it was possible to observe that the same programming/scripting languages of the last few years (Python and Javascript) continue to be the ones that professionals are aiming to learn. It was also possible to observe that new programming languges such as TypeScript, Go and Rust are starting to get users' attention.
Regarding AI, a big portion of users (70%+) are already using these tools and most of the responses (75%+) are favorable on them. In addition to that, it was verified that the years of coding experience of users don't have an influence on the sentiment about using AI, which means that there is a level of acceptance of AI across differente "coding generations".\
